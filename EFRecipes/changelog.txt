Patreon suggestions:
- Shaved Ice (glacier ice, syrup (fruit, maple, honey, etc.)
- Ice cream (glacier ice, salt, milk/soy milk, honey (optional), syrup (fruit, maple, etc.)(Optional) (Could be mixed in the mixing bowl into a cooking pot?)
- Fruit Leather (fruit mash and fruit syrup mixed into a paste then baked in oven)
- Flower Bread (like fruit bread, but with flowers. Mainly aesthetic, but maybe different flowers can add buffs? I.E. catmint = temporary health regen, woad = temporary improved movement speed, etc.)
- Cake (flour, milk, egg, salt, flavorings (optional but can range; flowers, herbs, fruit, honey, etc.) (Can be cut like cheese wheels or pies)
- Cheesecake (regular pie crust, cottage cheese or regular cheese filling)
- Hard Tack (flour, bread crumbs, water. Lasts forEVER. Not literally, but sailors used it for nutrition when at sea. so I think it'd be cool to add.)
- Honeyed Wine (Wine mixed with honey. That's it. Adds extra nutrition or can be a buff of some sort.)
- Creme Brulee (Milk [or if the below ideas are considered, heavy cream], egg yolks, honey, salt) (all mixed together in a mixing bowl into smaller bowl/s, then baked in the oven.)
- Cookies (Seriously, how do we not have these yet?) (Honey, flour, milk/soymilk/water, berries/carrots)
- Butter that can be churned in a butter churn after milking an animal
- Can use the buttermilk leftover from making the actual butter in place of milk in recipes

Vityuri suggestions:
- Pickled and cooked vegetable for required ingredients in soup. Many cuisines have preserved pickled vegetable in soup. Like sichuan fish soup with pickled mustard greens, polish pickle soup.
- Fried meat, dried fruit, cooked vegetables, and broth in pilaf. There are so many types of pilaf, and it is often rice mixed with cooked food. Food on rice is a staple dish in many places, maybe have it a mixing meal (?)
- Cooked meat, vegetables as pie filling. Also boiled and pickled eggs in pies. Sliced boiled eggs are used in curry puff too.
- Eggs and also cooked vegetables in dumplings. Scrambled eggs and chinese chives are a common filling in dumplings.
- Eggs and soy sauce in porridge. Few drops of that can be added when eating congee, a type of porridge.
- Peanut sauce, cooked vegetables in salads
- Grubs can be added as optional protein in some food like dumplings and meals like porridge.
- Fried grubs and termites
- Fried dumplings. Adding toppings on cooked dumplings like how breaded food has the deluxe version.
- Egg pudding and bread pudding  (optional alcohol)
